# 10 C Language Projects (Hard LVL)

This project includes the code for fundamental algorithmic problems that I created when starting out in software development and the C language. The codes consist of 10 different problems arranged from easy to difficult, which helps improve software skills from basic to complex. The codes in the project not only assist in enhancing basic C programming skills but also foster algorithmic thinking. This way, programming skills and problem-solving abilities are developed step by step, enabling a more competent entry into the world of software.

The fundamental algorithmic problems included in this project provide an opportunity to improve software skills by solving them step by step. By examining these codes, you can learn the basic structures of the C language and algorithm design. Additionally, by developing problem-solving abilities and algorithmic thinking, you can enhance your intellectual capacity.

In conclusion, the code for fundamental algorithmic problems included in this project is ideal for improving programming skills and algorithmic thinking when entering the world of software. By solving problems step by step, it enhances mastery of the basic C language and enables approaching more complex software projects with increased confidence.

## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I had the opportunity to enhance my fundamental skills in the C programming language. I encountered various challenges, but I learned to solve them using debugging techniques and step-by-step approaches. I also discovered the importance of organizing code in a modular way and communicating between functions. Throughout this project, I improved myself by facing these challenges, practicing and using external resources.

I strengthened my fundamental skills in the C programming language and enhanced my problem-solving abilities in this project. I adopted a patient and systematic approach to overcome challenges encountered during the debugging process. Additionally, I applied modular programming principles to make the code more sustainable and readable. By practicing documentation and commenting in this project, I increased the comprehensibility of the code and facilitated collaboration. These experiences significantly improved my programming skills and intellectual capacity.

In summary, by developing my fundamental skills in the C programming language through this project, I made a stronger start in the world of software. I made efforts to overcome challenges encountered and adopted a solution-oriented approach step by step. Through the codes and algorithms provided in this project, I increased my intellectual capacity and advanced my problem-solving skills. The experiences gained from this project helped me approach more complex projects in the future with increased confidence.

## Features

- ASCII Table: This project likely involves displaying the ASCII table, which shows the numerical representation of various characters in the ASCII encoding system.

- Number of Elements: This project calculates and returns the count or number of elements in an array, list, or collection.

- Array Length: The project computes and provides the length or size of an array, indicating how many elements it contains.

- Array Sum: In this project, the sum of all elements within an array is calculated and returned.

- Max Number: This project finds and returns the maximum (largest) number in an array.

- Sum Array: It involves adding or summing up the elements of an array and returning the total.

- Ascending Order: This project arranges elements in ascending order, typically using algorithms like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort.

- Descending Sort: Similar to the previous project, but it sorts elements in descending order.

- AZ Sorting: In this project, a list of words or strings is sorted in alphabetical order, from A to Z.

- ZA Sorting: Similar to the previous project.
